Magnezone is a bot for Discord, a chat platform targeted at gamers. I made this for some friends in a server I was in, to automate some of the boring stuff and to have a few fun functions for us to play around with. The themeing was after a Pokemon police officer in a spin off game we had all played.

This was my first experience working with an API, and with hosting something I created in a server with AWS. While the server isn't running now, it'd be super easy to rehost if we ever wanted it in a server again!
