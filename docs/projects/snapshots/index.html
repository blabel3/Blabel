			<h1>Snapshots</h1>

				<p>Throughout my internship at Dow Jones, I worked on a team with Barron&rsquo;s engineers on their live website. This was my first time getting a taste of production-ready software, with multiple servers, staging and testing sites, and a really defined smooth Agile workflow.</p>
<p>I made edits to their frontend end backend, and also got to make a project all by myself that would solve an issue they were having: they weren&rsquo;t really able to look at older versions of their website. Frequently, they&rsquo;d want to look at an older version of their site to compare changes over time, and even checking out older code wasn&rsquo;t the best as builds and checkouts were slow, especially with three different sites and some shared code that needs to be in specific versions for each as dev builds aren&rsquo;t always stable.</p>
<p>To solve that problem, I made a service that would run in their AWS servers at scheduled times that would take a screenshot of their sites to compare with. That&rsquo;s Snapshots! Since it used a headless version of Chrome, it was exactly what the majority of viewers would see when they visited the site. It would take them in a variety of screen sizes too, so every breakpoint was covered. Designers could also use them as a base to start Figma files from easier, without having to screenshot and stitch together a big shot of the page, as Snapshots screenshotted the whole page all the way to the bottom.</p>
<p>I presented Snapshots to the CEO, CTO, and other tech execs across Dow Jones on the last week of my internship, with a <em>live demo</em>! It was nervewracking but I made absolutely sure everything would work, and it went without a hitch and made a much stronger impression. I asked if I could showcase the code I wrote here before leaving the company, and they agreed. SO now it&rsquo;s part of my showcase, and definitely one of the projects I&rsquo;m most proud of.</p>
