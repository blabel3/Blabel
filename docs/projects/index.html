	<div>
		<p>This is the first app I&rsquo;ve taken from development to a full release on the app store all by myself! It&rsquo;s on both the Android and iOS app stores.
This project actually started as an Android-only app I made at McHacks 2019, since I had just started as the webmaster for the college radio station and wanted to make an app for it. I was able to release it on the store during that hackathon&ndash;although it didn&rsquo;t get up on Google&rsquo;s servers till the next day.</p>

		<p>Throughout my internship at Dow Jones, I worked on a team with Barron&rsquo;s engineers on their live website. This was my first time getting a taste of production-ready software, with multiple servers, staging and testing sites, and a really defined smooth Agile workflow.
I made edits to their frontend end backend, and also got to make a project all by myself that would solve an issue they were having: they weren&rsquo;t really able to look at older versions of their website.</p>

	<time>November 11, 2018</time>
	
	<div>
		<p>Oculus was made duiring BostonHacks 4, with a team of four. We then focused on two main parts, building a robot to travel along a path, and a vr interface that can create the path and send it over a network to the robot.
I was one of the members who focused on the VR interface. We got an Oculus GO and a Leap Motion for hand tracking, provided by MLH at the event.</p>

	<time>November 4, 2018</time>
	
	<div>
		<p>I made E-Mission at WHACK 2018, the hackathon Wellesley College puts on. It was the first hackathon I went to all by myself&ndash;without knowing anyone else at the event! I had a blast, and in 48 hours I had three more friends and an app I was proud of.
At team formation I found someone who was looking for a programmer who had worked with Android before, so I joined up with them.</p>

	<time>August 2, 2018</time>
	
	<div>
		<p>This was a warm up website made during Hack Chicago 2018, as part of a one-hour workshop. We made sites inside of repl.it, and then demoed them to each other at the end of the workshop. At the time I didn&rsquo;t have a laptop other than my dad&rsquo;s ancient one which I had brought, that crashed when trying to open a text editor. This was probably the smoothest time coding I had during that hackathon, although of course my browser crashed twice over that hour!</p>

	<time>April 23, 2018</time>
	
	<div>
		<p>Magnezone is a bot for Discord, a chat platform targeted at gamers. I made this for some friends in a server I was in, to automate some of the boring stuff and to have a few fun functions for us to play around with. The themeing was after a Pokemon police officer in a spin off game we had all played.
This was my first experience working with an API, and with hosting something I created in a server with AWS.</p>
